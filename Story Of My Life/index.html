                            Not just by my self but because of the people around me who helped me a lot in different things. They have been with me not because of what I can give but because of who I am.
                            We made memories that we will forever keep and cherish as we grow older and live our different lives. There is no hard obstacles if you have friends who helps you and grows with you.
                            They made tough problems into easier one's, thats why I dont regret meeting them and sharing a part of my life.
